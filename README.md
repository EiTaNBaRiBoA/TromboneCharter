# Trombone Charter
## A TMB editor for custom Trombone Champ charts.

### Features:
 * Drag-and-drop note editing.
 * Streamlined slide editing.
 * Keyboard for playing reference pitches.
 * Section preview playback.
 * Section copy.
 * Lyrics editor.

### Usage
#### Note editing
 * Click anywhere in the chart to add a note.
 * Click on a note's start to move it in time.
 * Click on a note's middle to change its pitch.
	* If a note is too small to easily grab its pitch handle, hold Shift to bring it to the front.
 * Click on a note's end to change its length and ending pitch.
 * Two notes, one beginning where the other ends, will form a slide if the pitches are the same. Changes to one of them will affect the other.
	* If you want to break a slide, hold Alt while editing one of its members.
#### Lyric editing
 * Use the button in "Editor Settings" to add a lyric.
 * The little handle right below the label can be used to drag it around.
 * The trashcan deletes the note.
 * This is all pretty much self-explanatory, right
#### Everything else
 * Hit "Preview" in Editor Settings to preview the selected section, with a metronome if the metronome checkbox is ticked.
	* Hitting Escape will end the preview early.
 * You can hold Shift when saving to bypass the Save As dialog.
	* Shift also bypasses the confirmation popup on section copy.
 * `note_color_start` and `note_color_end` will be populated iff "Use custom note colors" is checked.
